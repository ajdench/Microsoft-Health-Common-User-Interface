1         INTRODUCTION
    A keyboard shortcut is a keyboard action that performs a task that would otherwise require use of a
    mouse or other input device. It may take the form of a single key press or a combination of keys
    that are pressed simultaneously. Keyboard shortcuts save time and effort for users, especially
    when working in a busy environment. They are essential for screen reader users, who rely on the
    keyboard as their main input device.
    This document describes the results of the ’Quick Wins’ activity in relation to keyboard shortcuts. It
    begins by defining the overall 'strategic focus' of the keyboard-related work within the Design Guide
    Workstream. This is followed by a description of the 'current focus' of activity, explaining the main
    considerations, research findings, suggested recommendations and associated benefits. The final
    section contains a proposed roadmap for future research within this area.

2         SCOPE
    The formulation of Design Guide recommendations with regard to keyboard usage is a long-term
    goal of the Design Guide Workstream. This overall goal is described below as the 'Strategic Focus'.
    As a first step towards this goal, the 'quick wins' activity has focussed on a core set of the overall
    requirements. This is described within section 2.2, “Current Focus”.

2.1       Strategic Focus
    The overall focus of this component is to provide a comprehensive set of recommendations for the
    implementation of keyboard navigation and shortcuts within NHS clinical applications.
    Keyboard navigation and shortcuts are critical features of the user interface across all NHS
    applications. Multiple applications may be used by individuals every day and the ease of switching
    between them while working efficiently is important.
    Standardising keyboard usage allows greater accessibility for all NHS clinical applications:
         NHS staff will be able to quickly adapt to new software regardless of origin. This is
          especially important in data entry components where touch-typing is used to increase
          efficiency and speed.
         Common navigation methods and shortcuts for text entry, field movement and general
          application management will ease acclimatisation for new or cross trained staff in the NHS.
    The aim of this research is to provide recommendations for keyboard access and navigation within
    NHS clinical applications. These recommendations will be focussed on increased patient safety
    through the promotion of common keyboard usage patterns. The key benefits of these
    recommendations are accuracy and efficiency of keyboard access.
    In order to fulfil the goal of formulating a set of recommendations for keyboard navigation and
    shortcuts the following research areas must be analysed:
         Published standards and guidelines
         Commonly used keyboard actions
         Ergonomic factors
         Accessibility needs
         Existing NHS clinical applications
    As a final step, the recommendations must be integrated within NHS clinical applications.
    Consideration must be given to the formulation of an appropriate process through which to ensure
    successful integration, while minimising effort from the application vendors.
    The strategic scope is illustrated in Figure 1:

                                                                                                      Page 2

2.2         Current Focus
   The 'Quick Wins' activity is focussed on the provision of a set of base guidelines for keyboard
   shortcuts. This encompasses research of existing standards and the proposition of 'common sense'
   principles, in order to form a set of suggested recommendations.
   The current scope is highlighted within figure 2.

                                                                                              Page 3

   Figure 2: Current Scope for Keyboard Navigation and Shortcuts

2.2.1           In Scope
   The current scope is defined as follows:
         Devise a set of hypotheses relating to keyboard shortcuts
         Research existing standards for keyboard shortcuts
         Research published keyboard shortcuts information from application vendors
         Formulate a set of base recommendations for keyboard shortcuts
         Propose general 'common practice' principles as potential recommendations
         Suggest a roadmap for future research to complete the overall strategic scope

2.2.2           Out of Scope
   The following areas are out of current scope:
         Keyboard navigation
         Comprehensive set of recommendations for keyboard shortcuts
         User research and ergonomics investigation
                                                                                           Page 4

HSCIC Controlled Document

        User testing of recommendations
        Analysis of keyboard shortcut usage within existing NHS clinical applications

2.2.3         Background
   No international standards for keyboard navigation and shortcuts exist. However there are some
   'de facto' standards which have been promoted by major software companies, some of which have
   become standard by commonality of use in productivity software and browsers. In addition there
   are sets of shortcuts used by assistive technology software to aid accessibility. Many of the above
   have been reviewed alongside existing Governmental and Authority guidelines.
   No standards or common shortcuts exist within the NHS.

2.2.4         Considerations
   The following considerations apply to NHS keyboard shortcuts implementation.

2.2.4.1          Patient Safety
   Patient safety is of prime importance across NHS clinical applications, where there is a need for
   both speed and accuracy during keyboard operation. Incorrect key presses may cause wasted time
   due to errors, such as lost data. In some cases the impact of a key press mistake may be much
   worse, causing potentially dangerous errors.
   The keyboard shortcuts used across NHS clinical applications can affect patient safety in many
   ways. An example is the incorrect selection of functionality within an application. Where keyboard
   shortcuts have conflicting functions across NHS clinical applications it is possible for an operator to
   select the wrong function or menu option. This may not be immediately apparent to the operator,
   potentially causing incorrect updates to a patient record.
   The proposed recommendations should enable a consistent implementation of keyboard shortcuts
   across NHS clinical applications. This in turn allows doctors, clinicians and other health
   professionals to use multiple applications in a consistent, efficient and safe manner.

       Note
       In all cases where keyboard conflicts currently occur it is important to ensure that the user will easily know
       that the wrong shortcut is being used.

2.2.4.2          Accessibility
   From an accessibility perspective, users should be able to operate all aspects of the applications
   with just a keyboard. It should not be assumed that the mouse is the input device used by all users.
   Keyboard shortcuts are a necessity for people who cannot use a mouse due to disability or
   unavailability of suitable hardware. The following groups of people particularly rely on keyboard
   shortcuts:
        Blind users of screen reader software (for example, Jaws ®, WindowEyes™) who are reliant
         on their own shortcuts
        Mobility impaired users who, for whatever reason, are unable to use a mouse
        Other non-mouse users (for example those with a broken or otherwise non-available
         mouse)
   From a legal perspective, the NHS has a responsibility to ensure that software can be used by
   employees with disabilities. See Part II – Employment of the Disability Discrimination Act.

                                                                                                                Page 5

   Some applicable accessibility guidelines include:
        IBM software guidelines 1.1 and 1.2
        Irish National Disability Authority (NDA) 1.1, 1.4, 1.5
        ISO standard 16071, sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2

       Note
       Increasing accessibility, by utilising the most functional and intuitive shortcuts for non-mouse users
       improves the ergonomics of keyboard use for all users.

2.2.4.3          Construction
   It is important that developers who design or modify applications ensure that shortcuts do not fail
   silently and that shortcuts do not perform hidden (unexpected) functionality silently.
        Provide feedback if a deprecated shortcut is activated by the user
        Provide feedback if context sensitive shortcuts are not used in the correct context

2.2.4.4          Ergonomic Factors
   The following is a list of important ergonomic factors for keyboard usage:
        Users will have various hand size, causing varied user experiences with respect to
         keyboard usage
        Left-handed and right-handed users will have different keyboard experiences. They will
         have a natural tendency to use different hands for applying keyboard shortcuts
        A standard 101 keyboard provides two CTRL keys
        Keyboards other than the standard 101 type will alter the assumptions

2.2.5         Assumptions
   The following assumptions have been made in relation to keyboard shortcut research and
   recommendations:
        Keyboard shortcuts are essential for user accessibility
        All users should be able to operate all aspects of the applications with a keyboard
        Keyboard shortcuts act as "expert" accelerators to actions within IT applications
        Keyboard shortcuts are commonly used and relied on in existing NHS clinical applications
        Intuitive and recognised keyboard mappings are important
        Ergonomic factors must be considered
        Keyboard shortcut combinations which cause conflicts with other important applications will
         have an impact on patient safety
        Users of NHS clinical applications will rely on familiarity with the keyboard to quickly
         execute the keyboard shortcuts they require to complete a task
        Only standard 101 keyboards will be considered
        The majority of users are likely to be right-handed
        It is anticipated that a majority of users prefer to execute one-handed shortcuts
        We will not be able to analyse NHS clinical applications within the 'Quick Wins' timeframe
                                                                                                                Page 6

2.2.6          Hypotheses
   The initial set of hypotheses are stated below. These must be tested through contextual research
   against current standards, analysis of actual shortcut usage and understanding the related clinical
   functionality.
   During the 'Quick Wins' activity we are working from the following hypotheses:

       1. Preference for ALT key Keyboard Combinations
          Keyboard combinations based on the ALT key will be best for execution of clinically
          specialised actions within a NHS clinical application, because:
               The ALT key is ergonomically well positioned (bottom left of keyboard, easy access
           on most keyboards)
                ALT+letter is commonly used for application specific functionality, usually driving
           internal navigation within menu items
                 ALT+number is not a commonly used combination, mostly restricted to WindowEyes
           screen reader, UK Government AccessKey Standards, and some other application specific
           functionality
                 ALT+Function key is not commonly used and tends to be used for application specific
           functionality. An exception is ALT+F4, which is used for close or quit.

       2. Adhere to Commonly Recognised Keyboard Assignments
          Where commonly recognised keyboard shortcut assignments exist, such as CTRL+C for
          Copy, they should be implemented within NHS clinical applications, because:
                  This will prevent potential conflicts between applications
                  The user should not need to relearn common shortcuts
       3. Use Function Keys
          The F1 key is commonly recognized as the means for accessing Help information within an
          application. All other function keys should be used for application specific functions,
          because this is a commonly implemented practice within existing computer applications.

       4. Avoid Customisable Keyboard Layouts
          The use of keyboard layouts that are customisable within an application must be avoided
          because customisation is likely to introduce:
                  Keyboard conflicts
                  Confusion between the assignment of tasks to keyboard shortcuts
       5. Separate Clinically Significant Features
          Within the implementation of keyboard shortcuts, clinically significant functions must be
          spatially separated from other functions. This will reduce the potential for clinical errors. For
          example, a shortcut for prescribing dangerous drugs (such as CTRL+A) should not be
          placed near shortcuts for mundane tasks (such as CTRL+Z)
       6. Associate Keyboard Shortcuts with All Functions
          All functions must have an associated keyboard shortcut, which should comply with the
          relevant operating system, because:
                  This is essential for accessibility for users who rely solely on the keyboard
                  This is recommended by several accessibility guidelines
                  It is a legal requirement Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA parts II and III)

                                                                                                         Page 7

HSCIC Controlled Document

       7. Avoid Conflicts with Existing Applications
          Conflicts with keyboard shortcuts within existing applications must be avoided, because
          such conflicts can have negative implications for patient safety, training and efficiency.
            Conflicts with keyboard shortcuts are defined where two applications have:
                  Two different actions that are assigned to the same keyboard shortcut
                  Two different keyboard shortcuts that provide the same action within an application

                                                                                                    Page 8

3         RESEARCH

3.1       Sources
    Information regarding existing keyboard shortcuts was gathered from the following sources.

3.1.1         UK Government Accesskeys Standard
    The UK government has issued guidelines for keyboard shortcuts that provide an alternative form
    of navigation on websites. These are becoming a standard and should be implemented on web-
    based applications where possible.
    Accesskeys allow users with limited physical capabilities to navigate more easily. However, there
    are some drawbacks:
        Functionality depends on the type of operating system being used
        The attribute is only supported by MS Internet Explorer 4 and above and by Netscape 6x
         versions
                              ®
        With Windows -based systems the user has to press the ALT key and the accesskey
        With the Macintosh system the user has to press the CTRL key and the accesskey
    For more information, see the UK government accesskey standards at the following location:
    http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/e-government/resources/handbook/html/2-4.asp#2.4.4.

3.1.2         NHS Identity
    The information on use of Government Accesskeys Standards within NHS web-based applications

3.1.3          Guidelines for Keyboard User Interface Design
   This MSDN article describes the guidelines for designing a keyboard user interface for Microsoft
   Windows applications. It includes the following suggestions:
         Well designed applications must be useable even when the keyboard is the sole input
          device
         Provide keyboard access to all features, and document the keyboard interface
             "It is recommended that the keyboard be able to perform the same tasks as a mouse
             device…"
         Provide consistent keyboard shortcuts
             "A consistent keyboard UI between applications helps users to learn and interact with new
             applications. An application must not affect any system-wide shortcut keys (a key or a
             combination of keys used to perform a command), such as the Windows logo key ( ) that
             opens the Start menu. An application must also follow commonly recognized shortcut key
             assignments, such as CTRL+C for Copy and CTRL+Z for Undo.
             However, this does not mean that all shortcut keys need to be standardized or that
             applications must always be forced to support the same shortcut keys. For example, not all
             applications need to support CTRL+P for printing."

                                                                                                  Page 10

        Keyboard UI Conflicts
            "You can assign shortcut keys in various ways by using a combination of standard keys and
            modifier keys. However, this can cause conflicts with applications that provide global key
            sequences for proprietary features, as do many assistive technologies. To prevent conflicts,
            do not use the Windows global key sequences or common sequences for shortcut keys.
            Keyboard UIs vary widely among assistive technologies, and may conflict with an
            application's shortcut keys. Therefore, provide custom shortcut keys for important
            keystrokes only, and avoid commonly used keys. For example, in many screen readers,
            users press the CTRL key to stop the speech review process. Therefore, you should
            perform usability studies on newly assigned shortcut keys and customizable shortcut keys
            to avoid conflicts with the system and other applications."
            This excerpt is taken from the Guidelines for Keyboard User Interface Design.

         appropriate groups. The last section (MSDN Guidelines) is for use to external developers who
         use Microsoft product development guidelines.
         This document offers some interesting statistics about keyboard usage, for example keyboard
         usage generally per hour by use of various keys.

   Handbook for Keyboard Design
             Melissa Jacobson, 56seven8 design, inc.
             30 June 2004
             This report details research undertaken at the beginning of May in 2004. Microsoft Wireless
             Optical Desktop (WOD) and WOD-Elite sets were deployed to over 75 primary users, along
             with tracking software developed by Pawin Suthapong which monitored the use of both
             mouse and keyboard hardware.
             Data was automatically uploaded to servers every 24 hours and compiled weekly for up to
             six months (business users) or nine months (home users).
             The average length of participation (adjusted for technical difficulties and occasional non-
             use) was: 32 weeks for novice home users, 39 weeks for experienced home users, and 26
             weeks for business users.
             In this report, all single stroke keyboarding activities are presented in summary form per
             total active hour of use.

   3-Month Real People, Real Data Report (3/22/2002)
         Hugh McLoone
                This report details research undertaken during March 2002. 27 participants in 12 homes
                in Chicago and Phoenix used either a Microsoft Office Keyboard or a Microsoft Natural
                Keyboard Pro in their homes. This study was conducted to record key usage among
                “real” people using Microsoft keyboard products. Computers were instrumented with
                tracking software to record key actuations and key repeats including key combinations.
         Results concluded that:
                 Nearly everyone used the letters, numbers across the top, tilde (~), Enter, space
                  bar, Delete and Backspace keys.
                 Approximately half of the participants used the numbers on the number pad.
                 The space bar was used 311 key depresses per day on average (850 key
                  depresses per hour of active use of keyboard).
                 The letter “E” was the most frequently used QWERTY key at 165 key depresses per
                  day on average (456 key depresses per hour of active keyboard use).

3.1.9.1          Notes from the Microsoft Product Group Regarding Keyboard
                 Usage
   Some general notes from the Microsoft Product Group:
        Sixteen users of the Wireless Optical Desktop Elite set responded to a question about
         whether they had “discovered” the shortcut markings on the keyboard. Of those, 10 (63%)
         said “yes”, 4 (25%) said “no”, and 2 (12%) said they were already familiar with the
         shortcuts.
        When asked if they thought these markings might be useful, 15 responded. 10 (67%) said
         “yes”, 4 (27%) said they were already familiar and didn’t need any reminders, and 1 (6%)
         said those keys were not working correctly anyway.

                                                                                                     Page 13

                            Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre

HSCIC Controlled Document

        Of the 43 people who responded to a question about how they felt about having shortcut
         markings on their keyboard, 1 (2%) said “hate it”, 7 (16%) said “like somewhat”, 18 (42%)
         said “like quite a bit”, and 17 (40%) said “love it”.
        Asked how often they might utilize these markings, 1 (2%) said “never”, 16 (36%) said “a
         little”, 17 (39%) said “quite a bit”, and 10 (23%) said “daily”.
        Although the markings seemed popular and useful, only 32% (14) said they would require
         these markings on future keyboards.
   Interpretation of these findings is that while the markings on the keyboard lead to the discovery of
   shortcuts, once people “know” them, they do not need reminders.
   One alternative to having multiple key depressions to perform shortcut tasks would be to have
   single touch functionality on the keyboard (perhaps as a replacement to “new, open, close” or
   “reply, fwd, send” on the alternate functionality of the function keys).

3.1.10        Application Shortcuts
   The research sources included over 3,000 shortcuts from 18 commonly used applications,
   browsers and accessibility products. The included shortcuts were mostly extracted from on-line

4            RECOMMENDATIONS
    The following recommendations apply to the use of NHS keyboard shortcuts across all operating
    systems and clinical applications.
    The recommendations are split into two areas:
           Current Recommendations
            Recommendations based on research undertaken during the Quick Wins phase. Comprises
            examples of specific shortcuts to use for the associated functionality in all applications
           Potential Recommendations
            Principles based on experience of 'common practice'. These must be validated through
            further research, analysis of existing clinical applications and user testing.

4.1          Current Recommendations
    The following recommendations include tables listing suggested mappings between shortcut keys
    and functions. Where matching functions exist in an application the related shortcut keys should be
    used.
    An explanation of the general justifications, benefits and drawbacks associated with all of these
    recommendations is included at the end of this section. Specific justifications, benefits and
    drawbacks are included within each recommendation.

4.1.1         ALT Key Shortcuts
    The following table lists recommended ALT key shortcuts. The Government Access Standards are
    included as they are the only standards available. (These standards apply to websites generally,
    but can be extended to web-based applications.)

    Key                     Functionality
    ALT+F4                  Quit Application

    ALT+V                   View Menu

    ALT+E                   Edit Menu

    ALT+F                   File Menu

    ALT+H                   Help Menu

    ALT+HOME                First/Homepage

    ALT+TAB                 Switch Windows

    ALT+ESC                 Display Next

    ALT+1                   Homepage (Government AccessKey standards)

    ALT+2                   What's New (Government AccessKey standards)

    ALT+3                   Site Map (Government AccessKey standards)

    ALT+4                   Search (Government AccessKey standards)

    ALT+5                   FAQs (Government AccessKey standards)

    ALT+6                   Help (Government AccessKey standards)

    ALT+7                   Complaints Procedure (Government AccessKey standards)

    ALT+8                   Terms and Conditions (Government AccessKey standards)

    ALT+9                   Feedback Form (Government AccessKey standards)
                                                                                                   Page 16

   ALT+S                         Skip Navigation (Government AccessKey standards)
   Figure 4: ALT Key Shortcuts

   Figure 5: Recommended ALT Key Shortcuts

4.1.1.1            Justification
   ALT keys were found to be in general use as menu shortcuts within MS Windows. In particular,
   some combinations are very likely to be found as menu shortcuts. Those menu shortcuts that were
   found to be common across applications were suitable for recommendation. Additional navigation
   keys were also found to have common functionality.
   The Government AccessKeys standard ALT key definitions were added to the list as the only set of
   actual standards currently available. Applicability is questionable as these are standards for web
   usage and they are not strictly adhered to anyway. Further investigation is required before these
   can be fully ratified as a recommendation that applies in all contexts.
   Special note is also given for the use of ALT-F4 key combination which would have severe
   implications should it be used for anything other than to quit an application.
          It is ergonomically well positioned (bottom left of keyboard, easily accessed with smallest
           finger of left hand)
          ALT+letter is commonly used for application specific functionality, usually opening
           application menus
          ALT+number is not a commonly used combination, mostly restricted to WindowEyes screen
           reader, UK Government AccessKey Standards, and minimal other application specific
           functionality
          ALT+Function key is not commonly used and tends to be used for application specific
           functionality (the exception is ALT+F4 which is used for close or quit)

4.1.1.2            Benefits
          Ergonomically friendly, in that users can use one handed execution, using the smallest
           finger for ALT and index or thumb for letter/number
          ALT+Function key for clinically significant shortcut keys is recommended (spatial distance
           is enough to separate from mundane keys)

                                                                                                   Page 17

4.1.1.3            Drawbacks
                  ALT+number – potential conflicts with Government AccessKeys (and other
                   applications)

4.1.2             Function Key Shortcuts
   The following tables list recommended Function key shortcuts.

   General Function Key Shortcuts
   Use the following Function keys for all applications and in most contexts:

   Key                           Functionality
   F1                            Help
   Figure 6: General Function Key Shortcuts

   Figure 7: Recommended Function Key Shortcuts (General)

   Browser Function Key Shortcuts
   In addition to the general function key shortcuts, for browsers we recommend using the following
   keys for the listed functions, based on general user expectations.

   Figure 9: Recommended Function Key Shortcuts (Browser)

   Justification
   Function keys are generally considered to be application specific. However it was noted that one
   key was used consistently across sources. This was the F1 key which is used for Help in some
   form across all the applications looked at.
   Other function keys have some potential for cross application conformity (for example within
   browsers) but further research is required to finalise these considerations.

   Benefits
          Quick, single key press - efficiency

   commonality across most, if not all applications were suitable for recommendation.
   These were placed into three sub-categories based on usage context. The usage contexts were:
                                                                                                  Page 21

          General
          Text Editing
          Browsers
   Differentiating these categories helps reduce unnecessary conflicts and provides better guidance to
   developers. Splitting into these categories also helps to consider assistive technology applications
   which have specific usage contexts and which might otherwise appear as conflicts with general
   application use.

   Figure 14: Other Recognized Shortcuts

   Figure 15: Recommended General Shortcuts

   Justification
   These shortcuts were found to have the same function across most applications.

4.1.4          General Justifications
   The justification for the current recommendations was determined by analyzing a number of
   keyboard shortcuts in use, over a number of different applications and sources, to look for common
   patterns of usage and levels of conflicts.
   Each keyboard shortcut was analysed for its usage across the featured applications and sources.
   Where conflicts occurred the usage context was taken into consideration such that shortcut keys
   that are used under widely different circumstances were not considered to be major conflicts.
   A dynamic list of keyboard shortcuts and their associated conflicts from the currently selected
   sources is being used as part of the ongoing research process.

                                                                                                     Page 22

HSCIC Controlled Document

   The primary considerations given to whether a keyboard shortcut should be recommended for use
   are:
        Patient Safety
        Governmental Standards
        Lack of conflicts with adaptive technology shortcuts
        Lack of major functional conflicts with existing applications
        Level of commonality of use across popular applications
        Ease of use with appropriate mapping between letter and function

4.1.5         General Benefits
        Avoids cognitive conflicts
        Prevents potential conflicts between applications
        Users will not have to "relearn" common shortcuts
        Reduces potential for patient safety issues (for example dangerous conflicts)

4.1.6         General Drawbacks
   There is always potential for conflict in these recommendations. It is impossible to eliminate
   conflicts, they can only be minimized.

4.2       Potential Recommendations
   These recommendations are not based on existing standards but rather are based on experience
   from common practice. These recommendations must be tested through user research and further
   investigation. An explanation of the justifications associated with all of these recommendations is
   included at the end of this section.

       1. Keep Shortcuts Simple
            Shortcuts must be simple, intuitive and easy to remember. Try to avoid shortcuts that use
            more than 2 key presses, for example, CTRL+SHIFT combinations. Shortcuts with more
            complicated key presses are difficult to remember and execute.
            Also, try to use an appropriate mapping between letter and function. Simple mapping helps
            users recall a shortcut combination.

       2. Use Common Shortcuts
            Use commonly recognised and existing shortcuts wherever possible, to meet with users'
            existing expectations and prevent them having to "relearn" shortcuts. Fitting in with user
            expectations generally reduces the potential for confusion and avoids cognitive conflicts.
            Some examples of common shortcuts in Microsoft Windows are:
                    F1 for Help
                    CTRL+C for Copy
                    CTRL+V for Paste

       3. Avoid Conflicts That Cause Confusion
            The NHS uses a large number of applications, which is likely to lead to shortcut conflicts.
            Avoid creating more confusion by only employing shortcuts that do not conflict with other
            applications.

                                                                                                    Page 23

                            Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre

HSCIC Controlled Document

            Further research needs to be undertaken to determine the significance of conflicts.

       4. Avoid Dangerous Conflicts
            In particular, do not use shortcuts that will conflict with any shortcuts used for opposite or
            contradictory features in existing applications, for example, do not use a shortcut for Close
            and Save if an identical shortcut for Close without Saving exists in another application.
            Further research needs to be undertaken to determine the significance of conflicts.

       5. Where possible, use single key press shortcuts
            For speed and efficiency, make use of single key press shortcuts (for example, the function
            keys) for application specific functionality as much as possible.
            The exception is F1 which should always invoke a help function of some description.

       6. Use simple CTRL and ALT shortcut combinations
            For mundane and general application specific tasks, where possible use simple CTRL and
            ALT shortcut combinations. These are the keys most comfortably accessed using smallest
            finger for depressing CTRL or ALT key and then index finger or thumb for second key press
            (assuming left hand usage). See later justification of recommendations.
            Use ALT+letter for recognized functions such as opening menus. These are generally
            application specific but some are recognized, such as ALT+F for file, ALT+H for Help.
            Use CTRL+letter for recognized functions, for example, in text editing mode use CTRL+C
            for copy, etc.

       7. Separate clinically significant functions from the mundane
            Where possible spatially separate clinically significant functions on the keyboard from
            mundane and general application specific features, to avoid unnecessary clinical errors.
            Ensure the user has to move their hand from its natural comfort zone to perform these
            tasks.

4.2.1         Justification
   Speed and accuracy are central to NHS work. Consequently, the keyboard manipulation that is
   required to enter and work with data, such as patient records, is at the heart of efficiency and
   safety.
   Best practice dictates:
        Quick and easily remembered shortcuts
        Intuitive mappings of shortcuts to functions
        Consistent mappings of shortcuts to existing functions where possible

   Modes of Operation
   When using IT applications users probably prefer one handed execution of keyboard shortcuts, as
   opposed to two. Most users are right handed (9 out of 10 people are right handed), so for these
   users the natural inclination is to use the left hand to execute keyboard shortcuts. The right hand
   will be busy doing other things like jotting notes, using mouse in tandem, etc.
   Patient engagement is also a consideration. Within the office setting where the patient and clinician
   are sitting together, the orientation of their bodies will affect the availability of hands to execute
   shortcuts. The natural inclination is to have the patient to the right of the clinician with the clinician's
   body turned slightly towards the patient. This setup lends itself also to left handed execution of
   shortcuts.

                                                                                                         Page 24

   Preferred Shortcuts
   The preferred keyboard shortcuts are probably going to be those that favour short, intuitive key
   presses reached comfortably with the left hand. As the left hand rests naturally at the bottom left of
   the keyboard these will be key presses using the CTRL and ALT keys (also these are commonly
   recognised keys used to invoke shortcuts).

   Figure 16: Keyboard Hotspots

   Assuming the smallest finger holds down the CTRL or ALT key, key presses located in the lower to
   upper, and left to middle of the keypad are optimum.
   The most natural and easiest to execute two-finger combinations are:
         Smallest finger with index finger (making optimum key presses CTRL or ALT+R,T,Y,U or
          numbers)
         Smallest finger with thumb (making optimum key presses CTRL or ALT+V,B,N,M)
   One finger key presses are also easy, making function keys ideal possibilities.
   Additionally, users will not mind moving their left hand from its natural position to the arrow keys or
   num pad for simple, single key press actions.

                                                                                                     Page 25

   Hotspots
   Optimum hotspots for using two key presses involving CTRL and ALT keys occur with the smallest
   finger depressing the CTRL or ALT key and the second key press executed using the index finger
   or thumb.

                                                                Difficult

   Figure 17: Keyboard Hotspots

   Within the easy zone (optimum hotspot):
         Certain keyboard shortcuts cannot be changed and must be used for the recognised
          function, for example:
                  CTRL+C=copy
                  CTRL+X=paste
         Certain keyboard shortcuts must not be used due to already too many existing conflicts, for
          example:
                  ALT+F
         Certain keyboard shortcuts are more likely candidates due to their use as application
          specific shortcuts only:
                  These are mostly based around the ALT key

   Within the difficult zone:
         Place clinically significant functions that may affect patient safety within the difficult zone,
          to avoid unnecessary clinical errors.

                                                                                                       Page 26

                Two hands?
                Issues with change from normal hand position?
        What difficulties are encountered, record and ask why
        Preferred usage (one/two hands, left/right hand), record and question why

                This will help to confirm both established and optimally efficient shortcuts.

5.2       Gather Feedback about Keyboard Shortcut Awareness
   Present questionnaires to establish usage and familiarity. The questionnaires will be presented to:
        A cross-section of the target users (NHS staff)
        A cross-section of other general users of IT Applications (non-NHS staff)

                This will help establish which keyboard shortcuts are commonly known and
                the proportion of users using these on a regular basis.

5.3       Determine Usage of Adaptive Technologies
   Contact established adaptive technology users and other relevant sources within the NHS to
   determine:
        What % of staff use adaptive technologies within the NHS?
        What are the most commonly used technologies, for example:
                Screen readers – JAWS, WindowEyes
                Screen magnifiers – ZoomText, SuperNova

       Note
       Predict that the most commonly used screen reader in the NHS is JAWS, it is by far the most popular
       generally. According to the research so far, JAWS conflicts minimally with other applications and uses
       unusual keystrokes - so should not cause too many problems with conflicts. WindowEyes on the other
       hand conflicts far more frequently; however it is not a widely used screenreader. Research needs to be
       carried out to confirm real world usage.

                Will help establish priorities for adaptive technologies keyboard shortcuts which
                will influence the final recommendations.

                                                                                                          Page 29

5.4          Collate and Analyse ISV Keyboard Shortcuts Information
   Collect as many existing ISV shortcut keys for inclusion as is possible:
         Some information will come from observations made during hospital visits, using the
          logging sheets
         Some information will come from other sources, such as the ISVs themselves

        Note
        Need to establish as many applications currently in use in the NHS as we can and get the (most common)
        shortcut keys used with these applications.

              Will allow more comprehensive recommendations to be made based on
              specific clinical functionality and associated keyboard shortcuts.

5.5          Categorise Applications According to Importance/Clinical
             Safety and Usage
   This process involves collecting information on which platforms, operating systems and software
   applications are used within the NHS.
   Suggestions include:
         Questionnaires to IT managers
         Target buyers and decision makers

             Will better target recommendations to the specific needs of the NHS
             environment, according to the most commonly used applications.

5.6          Perform Further Research into Keyboard Ergonomics
   Research relevant papers, books, document observations made during hospital visits and perform
   a number of real user tests to gather qualitative and quantitative data.
   This will help to determine:
          Favoured hotspots
          Ergonomic efficiency, for example, with one hand
                    CTRL Z and CTRL X easy
                    CTRL O, CTRL P difficult
                    Preferred method – one handed or two handed
                    Change of resting/normal hand position to perform the shortcut
                    Effectiveness of alternate keyboard layouts – not everyone uses a standard keyboard

                    Will extend recommendations based on existing research.

5.7          Produce Developing and Refined Recommendation Lists
   Producing extended and refined recommendation lists based on the research. These lists will
   outline:
          Commonly used keyboard shortcuts which must maintain a consistent mapping to existing
           functions
          Potential areas of concern regarding existing conflicts
          Keyboard shortcuts that are available for as yet undefined application specific use

                    Refined recommendation lists will develop in parallel to research undertaken.

                                                                                                     Page 31

                                                                                 recommendations lists

   Figure 22: Recommendations Lists

        Note
        Specifications for the required applications will help clarify further research and direct analysis to provide
        more focused recommendations, for example, knowledge of likely menu items allows recommendation to
        be made regarding appropriate ALT+shortcuts for activating these menu options.

5.8        Future Considerations
5.8.1          Management
   A complete recommendation for keyboard shortcuts must also look at the management of these
   shortcuts in the future. This includes considering:
         Storing a dynamic keyboard shortcuts list/database
         Distributing shortcut definitions and guidelines to ISVs
         Ensuring information provided to ISVs is always up to date
         Managing requests for changes and additions

5.8.2          Documentation
   There is a requirement for good documentation and educational assistance for the shortcuts that
   are available - to aid learning and memory.

5.8.3          Use of Sticky Keys
   Sticky keys are a method of typing where modifier keys, such as CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT will "stick"
   down and apply to the next keystroke, so that only one key needs to be pressed at a time. This is
   extremely useful for people who have motor impairments that make it difficult to press combinations
   of keys at the same time.
   Applications must support sticky key features. This may need emphasising in documentation and
   education to highlight these features for end users.

5.8.4          Internationalisation
   Keyboard mappings vary across global regions; for a complete set of recommendations these
   variations should be considered:

5.8.5          Non-Standard 101 Keyboards
   There are many types of keyboard currently in use. These include:
         Ergonomic keyboards

                                                                                                                 Page 32

        Peripheral keyboards (mobile add-ons)
        Laptops
        Mini Keyboards
        Left Handed Keyboards
        Programmable Keyboards
   Non-standard 101 keyboard devices will have different keyboard shortcut requirements.

5.8.6         Non-Standard Devices
   There are many types of non-standard devices in use. These include:
        Tablet PCs
        Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)
   Non-standard devices will have different keyboard shortcut requirements.

5.8.7         Dvorak Keyboard Layout
   The Dvorak keyboard rearranges the keys on the keyboard so that highest frequency keys are
   located on the home row, with lower frequency keys on the other rows.
   Dvorak keyboard users will have very different keyboard shortcut requirements.

                                                                                            Page 33
